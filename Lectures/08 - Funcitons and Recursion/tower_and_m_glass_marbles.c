 * Description: Solves the tower and m glass marbles problem. The user is      *
 *              prompted to enter the number n of floors of a building.        *
 *              Using m marbles, one has to discover the highest floor,        *
 *              if any, such that dropping a marble from that floor makes      *
 *              it break, using a strategy that minimises the number of        *
 *              drops in the worst case (it is assumed that any marble would   *
 *              break when dropped from a floor where one marble breaks, and   *
 *              also when dropped from any higher floor; the marbles might     *
 *              not break when dropped from any floor).                        *
 *                                                                             *
 *              The idea is to ask: what is the maximum height h of a building *
 *              such that an answer can always be found with no more than d    *
 *              drops? Let H(d, m) denote that maximum height.                 *
 *              - If the marble breaks, m - 1 marbles remain                   *
 *                and no higher floor needs to be tested.                      *
 *              - If the marble does not break, m  marbles remain              *
 *                and no lower floor needs to be tested.                       *
 *              - In any case, d - 1 drops remain.                             *
 *              This yields: H(d, m) = H(d - 1, m - 1) + H(d - 1, m) + 1.      *
 *              The base cases are when either d = 0 or m = 0, in which case   *
 *              H(d, m) = 0.                                                   *
 *              This allows one to compute d as the least integer with         *
 *              H(d, m) >= n.                                                  *
 *              For the simulation, if low is the highest floor from which     *
 *              it is known that a marble can be dropped without breaking,     *
 *              d' is the number of drops that remain, and m' is the number    *
 *              of marbles that remain, then the next marble should be dropped *
 *              from floor low + H(d' - 1, m' - 1) + 1.                        *
 *                                                                             *
 *              Set B(0, k) = 1 for all k, B(n, 0) = 1 for all n, and          *
 *              B(n + 1, k + 1) = B(n, k) + B(n, k + 1).                       *
 *              The recurrence relation is identical to the one that           *
 *              determines the binomial coefficients.                          *
 *              It is easy to verify that:                                     *
 *              - H(n, k) is equal to B(n, k) - 1;                             *
 *              - if k > n then B(n, k) is equal to B(n, n);                   *
 *              - if k <= n then B(n, k) is equal to the sum of n choose k1    *
 *                where k1 ranges over {0, ..., k}.                            *
 *              The values B(n, k) determine the Bernouilli rectangle,         *
 *              whose rows are computed similarly to the rows of               *
 *              Pascal triangle. The program makes direct use of B(., .),      *
 *              and indirect use of H(., .).                                   * 
 *                                                                             *
