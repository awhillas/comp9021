 * Description: Solves the tower and 2 glass marbles problem. The user is      *
 *              prompted to enter the number n of floors of a building. Using  *
 *              2 marbles, one has to discover the highest floor, if any,      *
 *              such that dropping a marble from that floor makes it break,    *
 *              using a strategy that minimises the number of drops in the     *
 *              worst case (it is assumed that any marble would break when     *
 *              dropped from a floor where one marble breaks, and also when    *
 *              dropped from any higher floor; the marbles might not break     *
 *              when dropped from any floor).                                  *
 *                                                                             *
 *              The idea is to ask: what is the maximum height h of a building *
 *              such that an answer can always be found with no more than d    *
 *              drops? It is easy to verify that h is the largest integer      *
 *              such that d + (d - 1) + (d - 2) + ... + 2 + 1 >= h, and that   *
 *              the strategy consists in dropping the first glass              *
 *              from floor d, then from floor d + (d - 1), then from floor     *
 *              d + (d - 1) + (d - 2), ..., until the marble breaks, if that   *
 *              ever happens. In case that happens and i is the least integer  *
 *              such that the glass breaks when dropped from floor             *
 *              d + ... + (d - i - 1) + (d - i), then one drops the second     *
 *              glass from floor d + ... + (d - i - 1) + 1,                    *
 *              and then from floor d + ... + (d - i - 1) + 2, etc.            *
 *              until the glass breaks, if that ever hapens.                   *
 *                                                                             *
