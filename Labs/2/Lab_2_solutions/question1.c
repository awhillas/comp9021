 * Description: Finds a strictly positive number                               *
 *              that satisfies 13 out of the 15 conditions:                    *
 *              - It is a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.           *
 *              - It is smaller than 1000, 750, 550 and 500.                   *
 *              - It is greater than 400 and 450.                              *
 *                                                                             *
